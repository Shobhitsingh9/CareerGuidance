            <h1>What should be the Career Objectives for a Fresher?</h1>
            <p>
                One of the most effective segments of a resume is the career objective. Starting from your skill sets and experiences that make you an ideal candidate for that vocation, it includes your career goals and where you see yourself in the near future. You can turn the odds in your favour simply by tailoring this section in a stirring manner, as it sets the tone for the rest of the interview and decides how the recruiter perceives you. Writing a precise and persuasive objective can be tricky and this blog provides some guidelines for the same.
            </p>
            <h3>Guidelines to write a career objective.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, resume objectives must be concise and pertinent, typically two to three sentences, or 30-50 words long. As recruiters browse through scores of resumes daily, it is essential to keep it short. This will also help the recruiter get an overview of your overall profile without going through the resume. It is a vehicle that helps you showcase how you would add value as an employee. Hence, it is important to align your content with your specific career goal. People switching their careers and entry-level workers should consider using an objective for a resume because their work history alone may not clearly define their goals.</li>
                <li>Adding a formal statement and reference to the job opening will display a thoughtful attitude to the hiring representative. Reveal your strong points. Focus on important virtues and skills, and mention at least 3-4 skills in your career objective. This will help the recruiter assess your personality easily. Even if you can’t show experience, mention any certifications, transferable experience or courses you have undertaken from various platforms, both online and offline. Transferable experience can refer to any professional experience from your previous workplace which is applicable to the present one, such as managerial skills can be applied for anyone looking for a specific job industry like hotel management. Incorporate relevant words that are mentioned in the job description as to show that the necessary criteria are being fulfilled. Also, many software or online websites scan resumes for keywords related to the jobs, skills and descriptions.</li>
                <li>With respect to the content, avoid using cliched terms directly from the internet. Instead, research on your field of interest and form cogent statements that define you. Moreover, using a thesaurus can prove to be a disappointment as more than your vocabulary skills, they are looking for relevance and confidence. Steer clear from conveying  ideas that say nothing substantial about your career goal. In case you have more than one career goal, create a different resume version for each objective.</li>
                <li>Try to use first-person pronouns, such as I, or me, as stringently as possible. For example, if you are looking for something in marketing, instead of saying “I have had an experience of over 5 years,” a better idea would be to say “A seasoned marketing professional.” If your qualification is from a renowned university, then it is recommended that you mention that. For example- “With a Management degree from AB University and an internship experience at a renowned MNC, I have developed solid leadership and management skills; Seeking a management position to bring forth innovative ideas, analytical approach along with superior product knowledge and organizational abilities.”</li>
            
            </ul>
