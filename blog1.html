                  <h1>Top 10 Commerce Colleges in India – Eligibility and Placements</h1>
          <p>Most people in India assume that the Commerce stream falls in between Science and Arts. People feel that there are fewer prospects here than in Science, which is a common misconception. There are endless opportunities in the Commerce domain, and it provides students with a wealth of career options to explore and grow in.

            A further common misperception among students is that commerce with maths brings up a large range of career opportunities, but commerce without maths offers limited alternatives. However, commerce without maths will not limit their career options in any way. Once a student has started to follow commerce and is in the process of selecting colleges, there are a few things to keep in mind, like: Eligibility, Entrance exams, the Curriculum, College Placements, and the Alumni.
