                  <h1>How to Cope with Covid as a Student?</h1>
                  <p>As the world becomes increasingly enmeshed, so do the risks we face. The COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped at national borders. People of all nationalities, levels of education, income, and gender have been affected.

                    No one ever imagined that a microscopic organism could cause such global harm. It has had a long-lasting impact that will take months, if not years, to recover from. The education industry, like every other sector affected by the virus, is no exception.
                    
                    Covid-19 changed the way we learned. Taking us away from attending classes, we are coping with digital learning, which has a significant influence on student productivity, putting a lot of strain on educators.
                    
                    Every student, as well as educational institutions, faces difficulty in imparting and continuing their studies at a time when one can simply contract this fatal disease by a mere touch. The onus here is on students to show discipline towards their life and their studies, as now they’ll not have a teacher or professor to check on them continuously.
                    
                    The bottom line is that we must remain motivated and make consistent efforts in the right direction while exercising extreme precaution at all times. Hence, this blog will give you few insights into how you can cope with covid as a student. Coping</p>
                <h2>Below are a Few Ways to Help You Cope with Covid as a Student</h2>
                <h2>1. Be Alert and Not Anxious</h2>
                <p>Reading about people who have all types of symptoms on the internet might make you start looking for even the tiniest changes in yourself. Your mind begins to rattle through the options, attempting to determine whether or not there is a threat and, if so, what should be done. Set a limit to your social media consumption and be cognizant of the content that you are viewing.
                    <br>
                    The idea here is to keep yourself well informed. Use credible sources of information to educate yourself about it like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to cut through the disinformation.
                    <br>
                    You can also refer to Worldometer. The website is essentially a meter that changes as it gathers data. The coronavirus website is interactive, allowing you to see the overall number of cases, recoveries, fatalities, and other statistics both globally and by nation.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Remember to Move a Little</h2>
                <p>Exercise releases endorphins, a hormone which your body produces in response to stress. Remember to exercise on a regular basis; even light exercise will go a long way in releasing the toxins from your body. Find exercises that you can accomplish inside the confines of your house or apartment complex, such as walking, running, or climbing stairs. Stretching activities and yoga can also help you stay healthy while also calming your mind or you can select from the plethora of workout apps easily accessible through your smartphone like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nike Training Club</li>
                        <li>Simply Yoga</li>
                        <li>7 Minute Workout</li>
                        <li>MyFitnessPal</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>3. Maintain a Routine</h2>
                <p>
                    You may be uninspired right now. Accept that the current situation is difficult for everyone. Don’t be too hard on yourself; just do your best.
                    <br>
                    Every day, start your day at the same hour. Set a target for how much coursework you want to do each morning and afternoon. Our sense of time and order has been thrown off by not attending school or college for a long time now. Make a short-term goal for yourself and a timeline or strategy for achieving it. To stay on track, make a to-do list of all the chores you need to complete in a day, even if they’re as simple as getting groceries. These apps can come in really handy for this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wunderlist</li>
                        <li>Todolist</li>
                        <li>Google Keep</li>
                    </ul>
                    These are just a few options that you can use, but there are many more similar apps that you can explore.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Try Your Hand at a New Skill</h2>    
                <p>
                    There was always something you wanted to learn or attempt but couldn’t, since you didn’t have enough time due to your hectic schedules and long tuition lessons. The one positive aspect of the Pandemic predicament is that we now have more time on our hands.
                    <ul>
                        <h3><li>Learn a new Language</li></h3>
                        <p>Want to understand that new KDrama that you’ve been watching better or your favourite anime that you’ve been watching with subtitles? I’m not recommending you become proficient in Korean by the end of the lockdown, but using apps like Duolingo or Babbel to learn the foundations of a new language might be beneficial.</p>
                        <h3><li>Read something completely unrelated to your subject</li></h3>
                        <p>Now is an excellent moment to broaden your horizons. Are you a psychology student? Pick up a history book and see what you can learn. With your pals, start an online book club. Combining reading with socialising is a great idea. Reading isn’t your thing? You might always try listening to an audiobook. Audible is now giving away hundreds of titles for free.</p>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>5. Prepare Yourself for the Real World</h2>
                <p>Everything may appear to be stationary right now, but we will soon return to our “regular” lifestyles. We all had plans for the future. Some of us were making the transition to senior classes. Some of us wanted to pass the entrance exam we’d been studying for to go into our dream college or university, but the pandemic has put that off. There are a few things you may learn to help you be more prepared:</p>
                <ul>
                    <h3><li>Online Courses</li></h3>
                    <p>You can take a variety of courses depending on your area of interest. Professors from prestigious universities such as Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and others are teaching these courses. You can do these for free from most platforms like Udemy, Class Central, Coursera, and so on.</p>
                    <h3><li>Virtual Internships</li></h3>
                    <p>A virtual internship is another way to learn how to put your abilities to use. Internships are available online from a variety of companies, allowing you to work from the comfort of your own home. Platforms like LinkedIn, Internshala and others can help you with it.</p>
                    <h3><li>Prepare for your Entrance Exams</li></h3>
                    <p>It’s reasonable that students are feeling insecure and unmotivated because of the postponement or cancellation of several entrance exams. Memory and problem-solving are two things that are examined in every entrance exam, regardless of the topic being assessed. These are the fundamentals. It’s beneficial to discover how to study more effectively and to comprehend the applicability of the things you’re learning. Solve sample papers and try to complete them in a time frame.</p>
                    <h3><li>Seek Expert Help</li></h3>
                    <p>It’s reasonable to be unsure about which subjects to study, which university to apply to, or which professional route to pursue during times like these. With the world currently working in virtual mode, it is now simpler than ever to contact a career coach and go through the career counselling process.</p>
                </ul>
                <h3>6. Reach Out to Others</h3>
                <p>You don’t get to see your peers on a daily basis anymore. They have most likely dispersed to various states, if not nations. Make a conscious effort to contact them on a frequent basis via phone calls, text messages, or emails. Join them for a virtual picnic!</p>
