					What is Career Guidance?
				</h1>
				
				<p class="text-small">
					Career development is more than just deciding on a major and what job
					you want to get when you graduate. It really is a lifelong process, meaning
					that throughout your life you will change, situations will change, and you
					will continually have to make career and life decisions. The goal of Career
					Counseling is to not only help you make the decisions you need to make
					now, but to give you the knowledge and skills you need to make future career and life decisions.
